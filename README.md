Project Title :- "Hangman Game"

- Hangman is a guessing game for two or more players. One player thinks of a word, phrase or sentence and the other(s) tries to guess it by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses. Originally a Paper-and-pencil game, there are now electronic versions.

- Here in the Project I have Used HTML Markup Language and JavaScript Scripting Language to built the 'Hangman Game' .

- A Hangman in Javascript is a word-guessing game. One Player picks a secret word, and the other player tries to guess it. The number of incorrect guesses before the game ends is up to the players, but completing a character in a noose provides a minimum of 10 wrong answers until the game ends.

- In Javascript file the six words given are :- ['blanket', 'apple', 'watermelon', 'building', 'orange', 'pineapple'] .

- Each time a new blanks of word letters are presented and the user is suppossed to guess the letters and the number of trials given are 10. Afer 10th guessing attempt if the letters selected are correct upto 10th trial attempt then the User or Player is displayed with the message 'Awesome! You're correct!' orelse if the no. of guesses exceed the no. of attempts given, to make & guess the correct word then the message displayed to the user is "Game Over!" .
